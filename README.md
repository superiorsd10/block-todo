The best way to better explore all the features of the **Block ToDo** is to fork and try out the project yourself and understand the complex structure of backend

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Solidity
- Hardhat
- Hardhat-toolbox
- Flutter
- Dart
- Nodejs
- Express
- MongoDB
- Nhost
- Pocketbase
- Solidity-coverage
- Truffle
- HD wallet
- Ethers
- Web3js

- Ganache-CLI
- Alchemy
- Polygon Matic
- Remix
- UNO & DIO
- Lottie
- Firebase
- Vercel
- Metamask
- GraphQL (Hasura)

### Backend

- Backend is developed using [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/):
  - JWT as a stateless authentication mechanisms for users and providers
  - MongoDB and pocketbase to serve simultaneously as database
  - nHost 
 <img alt="BlockTodo logo" src="./public/Images/nhost.png" width="560px"/> 
  - Bcrypt to encrypt passwords and auth

### Frontend

- Users can signup/signin with Google-auth (firebase) or Email/password 
- Add / Delete / Modify /complete a task
- Captcha for adding a task.
    - Slider captcha to prevent bots
    - Most user friendly captcha method
- Claim / Spend Reward coins
- Set A deadline to complete the task and earn rewards
- Realtime monitoring of tasks added to prevent frauds

*Coins*
- Task completed before deadline && Task verified : +10 ü™ô
- Task cross deadline || unncessary tasks : -10 ü™ô\
- Spend coins in the Reward section for redeeming gifts & goodies


> ‚òùÔ∏è It was well and easy to create a website with frameworks like Vue, React or Nextjs. But the ultimate cross plaform compactable application with best possible efficiency and performance is done best using flutter

### Blockchain

- Contracts written and tested over hardhat and powered by polygon blockchain
- Cryptographically records each records to prevent any kind of fraudary or data breach
- **Data abstraction**: Users are not required to pay any kind of transaction fee or gas fee for any of the transations (*Please don't abuse the system over this*) 
- Web3js and ethers used over the express framework to keep live interaction with polygon blockchain
- ganache and truffle used as dependencies for development 
- Verified and source code published
